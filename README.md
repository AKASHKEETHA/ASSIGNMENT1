# ASSIGNMENT1
DATASCIENCEMASTERS COURSE FIRST ASSIGNMENT 
1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
'hello'
-87.8
-
/
+
6
ANSWER:  values:hello,-87.8,6.
         expressions:*,-,/,+
         
2.What is the difference between string and variable?
ANS:-STRING:-It is a collection of characters .In python strings are enclosed in single/double inverted commas.
    eg="AKASH"
    VARIABLE:Variable is nothing but a name of memory unit that stores the data of any type.It creates memory in RAM.
    eg=a=10 ,here a is a variable that is storing integer value in it.

3. Describe three different data types.
ANS:-INT : It can store only integer values
eg:-1,2,3,4,5etc
FLOAT:-It can store only floating point values
eg:-11.2,22.345,66.253etc
BOOLEAN:-It stores only boolean values i.e.True and False.

4.What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
 ANS:-An expression consists of both operators and operands.operators are all arithmetic(+,-,*,/,%) assignmnet(=),relational(<,>,!=,>= ,<=,==),binary(&,|,<<.>>)etc.
  An expression evaluates the value 
  eg:-
        a=10
        b=20
        x=a+b     /expression
        x=30
 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
ANS:-An expression consists of both operators and operands.operators are all arithmetic(+,-,*,/,%) ,relational(<,>,!=,>= ,<=,),binary(&,|,<<.>>)etc.
  An expression evaluates the value 
  eg:-
        a=10
        b=20
        x=a+b     /expression
        x=30
 STATEMENT:
 Statements are nothing but commands that python interpreter executes 
 eg:-print()
 
 
 
 
 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
ANS:-
 
 
7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam'+'spamspam'
'spam' * 3 
 ANS:
      The result will be same
      In first case concatenation happens
8.Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid? 
 According to the naming convention a variable shouls start with alphabetsbut  should not start with numbers hence 100 is a invalid variable name and eggs is a valid name .
 
9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
ANS:
    int(),float(),str()
    
 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten' + 99 +  'burritos'
ANS:-Here we get error as we are concatenating strings with integer value.To concatenate every thing should be of same datatype.To concatenate here we need to typecast integer to string.
